# Python sorting scripts

Bubble-, selection-, insertion-, heap- and quicksort in one python script It will ask you how big you want the array to be, sort it, and show you:
 - Amount of comparisons
 - Amount of swaps
 - Time elapsed

I made this for a high school paper and it was quite an interesting start with Python.

## Usage

Just run the "sortingScript.py" file and follow the instructions. The maximum length of the array is currently 50.000 because of the slower algorithms used.

## To do's

 - Print the total elapsed time
 - Add algorithm selection (for bigger arrays)
